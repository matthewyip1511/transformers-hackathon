# An Intro to our Telegram Bot
Hello!

We created this bot drawing inspiration from the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. 

Back in 2021, Singapore faced a surge of COVID-19 cases that overwhelmed the Ministry of Health in Singapore. Most people called the MOH hotline when they were unsure what to do with regard to COVID-19, but this flooded their hotlines and they were not able to answer most of their concerns. This was because they had no way to filter the urgency level of incoming messages and therefore had to answer to them one by one manually.

We created this telegram bot to overcome this challange. We made use of the text classification ability of GPT-3 to classify incoming messages to the bot based on their urgency levels, and the right level of assistance would then be provided.
